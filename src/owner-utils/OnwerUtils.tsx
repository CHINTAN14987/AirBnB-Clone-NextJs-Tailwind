The staff were so friendly and helpful and the location was perfect - close to everything but felt exclusive and private too. Great coffee shop next door perfect beach sunsets at the end of the road, everything you need nearby. We will be back!!!!",

The common space at the living & dining was so comfortable that we spent most of our time there. They even had their own water dispenser, in-villa massage upon request and delicious meals prepared. Definitely miss my stay there!",

Wenni was so very kind to us all - a beautiful smile. All the girls were lovely so unobtrusive but there when you need them. A truly wonderful place to unwind and re charge thank you.",
